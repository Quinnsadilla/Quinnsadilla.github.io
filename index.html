				<h3>About Me</h3>
				<p>I’m a proud graduate of the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, where I earned my Bachelor’s degree
					 in Computer Science with a concentration in Data Science, along with a minor in Outdoor Adventure Leadership.</p>
				<p>I currently work as a Community Facilitator for Venture Outdoor Leadership, a role I’ve held for the past few 
				years while completing my degree. I staff challenge course programs and lead adventure trips for students at UNCC. 
				This past summer, I led a five-day backpacking, rock climbing, and canoeing trip for incoming freshmen. My work allows
				me to combine my love of the outdoors with my passion for helping others grow in confidence and teamwork.</p>
				<p>When I’m not working, you’ll often find me outside—hiking, backpacking, or biking with friends and family. 
					I also enjoy creative hobbies like painting and baking.</p>
