            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>During my time at UNC Charlotte, I have completed various projects for my classes. Here are some of the projects I have worked on:</p>

            <h3><a href="itis3135/">Building a Website</a></h3>
            <p>For ITIS-3135 Web App Development, I was tasked with creating six different websites throughout the semester.</p> 
            <p>The first project was to create a homepage for my personal UNC Charlotte site. This is the current site, which I have since expanded to include multiple pages with more information. The second was a class-specific site for <a href="itis3135/index.html">ITIS-3135</a>. The third was a mock business website that included my name, which can be found in the <a href="itis3135/migliaccio.co/index.html">footer of my ITIS-3135 site</a>.</p> 
            <p>The fourth project was a hobby website that focused on one of my personal interests. This website was designed as a multi-page site contained within a single file. You can view it here: <a href="itis3135/hobby/index.html">Hobby Site</a>.</p> 
            <p>The final project was a client-based website. For this assignment, I created a site for the Girls Who Code club at UNC Charlotte at the request of a friend. This project can be found by clicking on <a href="itis3135/project/index.html">Client Project</a>.</p>

            <h3><a href = "https://qmigliac.wixsite.com/qmigliaccio">Data Mining</a></h3>

            
            <h3><a href = "https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/quinn.migliaccio/viz/Airbnbratingsandpricestory/Airbnbratingsandpricefindings">Tableau</a></h3>
            <p>Links to my final storyboard that shows a breakdown of factors affecting NYC's Airbnb prices.</p>
