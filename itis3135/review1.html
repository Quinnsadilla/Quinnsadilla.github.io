                <li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>There is good contrast, and the font and sizing look good. Everything is easy to read.</li>
                        <li>Uses a linked CSS file, and the color choices complement each other nicely.</li>
                        <li>CRAP
                            <ul>
                                <li>Contrast - looks good.</li>
                                <li>Repetition - colors, footer, and additional elements are consistent across pages. The only one that is different is the form, which looks like the CSS was not properly linked.</li>
                                <li>Alignment - on Projects, Blog, and Events pages, it looks good. The header and footer also look good. However, the alignment of the h2 is not consistent across pages. It is left-aligned on most pages but centered on the About page. On the Home page, the images are not centered, and the text looks a little strange being left-aligned here. Consider changing this to use figcaptions for each image that are centered under them. On the About page, the paragraph should be left-aligned as center-aligned paragraphs often look off.</li>
                                <li>Proximity - looks good on all pages.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Has a home page and at least four other pages.</li>
                        <li>The navigation bar is clear and consistent across all pages.</li>
                        <li>Not all the links to external sites are working. Most of the links in the footer link back to the current page. If this is just a placeholder for now, don't forget to update them to working links. I also recommend linking the email in the footer allthough not nessesary.</li>
                        <li>The Blog page has a similar issue where the "Read More" links on each post lead to a 404 Not Found page.</li>
                        <li>The layout of the Events page looks good, but it is lacking information.</li>
                        <li>The form looks good and requires all parts to be filled out. However, as mentioned above, the CSS is missing.</li>
                        <li>The Projects h1 is test instead of "Project".</li>
                        <li>The h2 at the top of each page is the same or similar to what is in the navigation bar, which is good. However, the h1 on most pages is also the same as what is in the navigation bar. It should be consistent across all pages. For this project, what is on the home page would work well for all the pages.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Overall, I would say that this is a great start to the project. There are just a few things that need to be added or adjusted.</p>
