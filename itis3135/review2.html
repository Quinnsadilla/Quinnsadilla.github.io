                    <ul>
                        <li>Contrast and sizing look good; everything is easy to read.</li>
                        <li>There is consistent styling in a CSS file.</li>
                        <li>CRAP
                            <ul>
                                <li>Contrast - There is good contrast; everything is easy to read.</li>
                                <li>Repetition - The header, nav, and footer are consistent across all pages. The only difference is a slight size difference in the site title on the home page.</li>
                                <li>Alignment - Alignment looks good; everything flows very nicely.</li>
                                <li>Proximity - Images and boxes have a nice layout that works well.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Contains all necessary parts: header, main, and footer.</li>
                        <li>Has an h1 as the header that is the name of the shop.</li>
                        <li>All pages have an h2 that is the same or similar to the nav bar.</li>
                        <li>The site contains a home page and four other pages.</li>
                        <li>The home page looks great.</li>
                        <li>The About page looks good. The paragraph under "Father and Daughter Duo" is center-aligned. I would recommend making it left-aligned.</li>
                        <li>The Services page looks good. However, it looks very similar to the home page. Consider adding more information about the services or using different images to make it distinct.</li>
                        <li>The Contact page has a very nice layout. The only problem is that the email address does not fit in the box properly. The contact form looks good.</li>
                        <li>The Gallery page does not have much content. Consider adding more photos of completed works.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Overall this project looks really good!</p>
