        <p><a href="https://girlswhocode.com/" id="nav-link" target="new">Girls Who Code</a> is an iternational program aimed to help teach and support girls and non-binary individuals in coding. During the acedemic year the program works to teach high school girls programming, robotics, and web design. Some of the sessons are able to have projects and trips to major companies such as X (twitter) and facebook. </p>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>GWC was founded by Reshma Saujani in 2012.  She was running for congress and during her campain found a lack of female representaion in computer science class rooms.  The organization started under the White House Science &amp Technology Initiative.   By 2014 there were more than 1,500 GHC clubs across the country. In 2019 the organization made plans to reach all 50 states with 10,000 individual clubs. The organization is sponcered by AOL, Google, Microsoft, and AT&ampT.  In 2018 GWC expanded to Canada and in 2022 expanded to India.</p>
        <h3>Clubs</h3>
        <p>The Girls Who Code after-school club program is open to middle and high school girls between 13-18.  These clubs are run by college students, teachers, librarians, or professionals in the technology industry. Club meeting times vary among clubs, but are approximately 20 weeks with 2 hour meetings per week. The club curriculum is built on four foundational computer science concepts: loops, conditionals, variables, and functions. The organization calls these the "core-four." Club activities consist of coding tutorials, pre-professional workshops, and community building events.</p>
        <h3>Summer Immersion Program</h3>
        <p>The Summer Immersion Program (SIP) was a seven-week in-person summer camp program offered for girls in tenth and eleventh grade to introduce them to the world of coding. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the program developed into a two-week virtual program. These summer camps are based at more than 80 technology companies across the United States, including Facebook, Twitter, Adobe, Prudential, Microsoft, and Sephora.  The company at which the SIP is based also offers a mentorship program that matches girls in the camp with women in the company. The core curriculum for the program includes lessons on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript programming languages with extra material varying between program sites. The program ends with a final group project, project showcase, and graduation ceremony.</p>
