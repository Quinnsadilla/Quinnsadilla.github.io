                </figure>
                <p>Fun fact: Mount Mitchell is the highest point west of the Mississipi river at 6,684 ft above sea level. It provides amazing views with a short hike from the visitor center up to the peak. There are also longer hiking options that start lower down towards the base of the mountain that provide more challenge for those seaking a more difficlut or longer trail along with camping locations for backpackers. </p>

                <h2>Best Times to Go</h2>
                <p>Hiking in North Carolina is possible year-round, though each season offers unique experiences. In summer, longer days allow more time to explore, but be prepared for high temperatures, especially in lower elevations. Fall, with its cooler weather and colorful foliage, is arguably the best time for hiking, drawing nature lovers from all around. Spring is also a great time to go hiking. The weather is getting warmer after winter and all the new foliage is coming in. New new leaves and flowers add to the already beautiful atmosphere.</p>

                <p>The fall season, in particular, is ideal for those who want to experience the beauty of changing leaves against North Carolina’s picturesque backdrops. For winter hikes, prepare for colder temperatures and snow in higher elevations, which can create a magical, quiet winter wonderland.</p>
                <p>Sunrise and sunset hikes are also beautiful. Just make sure to check trail hours, have a sourse of light, and make sure to have additional layers.</p>

                <h2>How to Prepare</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Check the weather forecast and ensure trail conditions are safe.</li>
                    <li>Verify that the park or area is open to visitors.</li>
                    <li>Plan your route and bring a physical or digital map.</li>
                    <li>Pack essentials like water, snacks, and navigation tools.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Preparation is key for a safe and enjoyable hike. Properly assessing your needs and potential trail hazards can help prevent issues like dehydration, navigation errors, or injury. Additionally, dressing in layers allows you to adapt to changing weather conditions during your hike. It is also recomended to wear synthetic material so that your clothes will dry quickly if wet.</p>
                <p>It is also important to wear shoes that will be comfortable and offer support. Hiking boots are a great option as they offer ankle protection but any shoes that you can walk in that will not give you blisters or hot spots will work.</p>
                <p>While on the trail it is good to follow the 7 prinicples of Leave No Trace</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Think and plan ahead</li>
                    <li>Walk and camp on durable surfaces</li>
                    <li>Dispose of waste properly</li>
                    <li>Leave what you find</li>
                    <li>Minimize campfire impacts</li>
                    <li>Respect wildlife</li>
                    <li>Be kind to other hikers</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Following these principles with help to ensure that you have a good trip and that you are leaving trail in good contition for those who come after you.</p>

                <h2>AI Prompts</h2>
                <p>Used chatGPT</p>
                <p>prompt- add more infromation to the paragraphs</p>
                <p>Promt- find a solution using css and/or JS that hides all sections except the one you have clicked. The idea is to mimic the nav bar in your main site, the user will click a "link" in your nav tag that will hide all the sections on the page and ONLY display info of the section of choice. So if you click on the word "Best locations" in the nav bar, it will only display the "best locations" section on the page and hide the rest so the user can't scroll to see it. 
                    Add your "links" to the different sections in the header bar in the nav tag, also make sure that you have a favicon as a divider (should also be different from all of your other pages). Included all of my code.</p>
                <p>This created the nav bar and wrote the script element.</p>
