                <h3><a href="https://www.coolmathgames.com/">Well Done</a></h3>
                <p>This is a game site that has several pages organized by type of games. The home page has new, top, and trending games along with a small selection of each genre of game. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Contrast: </strong>There is a good contrast between the text and the background color. The headings of each section are bigger and in colored boxes showing that they are the heading of each section.  </li>
                    <li><strong>Repetition: </strong> There is a consistent color scheme between all the pages. The header and footer are also the same between all pages. </li>
                    <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> While there are not physical lines seperating the sections the layout creates lines between the sections. All the sections are aligned and have even spacing. </li>
                    <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> There are clear divisions of sections and the layout flows well. </li>
                </ul>

                <h3><a href="http://www.monkzone.com/">Terrible</a></h3>
                <p>I belive this is the site of a music artist called the Monk. The index page has a few links one of which is to the rest of the site and a large paragraph that has text above it saying not to read it. There are 21 pages (not all work) including store, biography, new releses, monk info, what's new, etc. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> The contrast is very bad on this site. The background is black with dark neon blue text making it very difficult to read. Links are also the same color as the text making them hard to tell the difference. The background of other pages on the site have images that have colors that make the text blend in. There is a little contrast in text size but not very much. </li>
                    <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> The font on each page appears to be the same but the font varries from page to page. There are consitent colors being used thought most of the pages for text colors, however the backgrounds very greatly. </li>
                    <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> There is no pattern to the layout. Some things are centered and others are left aligned with no margin.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Somme of the pages have sections dividing the information.  Most of the pages are a title and a block of text. There is also a lot of unnessisary white space on many of the pages.</li>
                </ul>
